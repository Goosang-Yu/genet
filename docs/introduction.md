## Welcome to GenET
GenET (Genome Editing Toolkit) is a library of various python functions for the purpose of analyzing and evaluating data from genome editing experiments. GenET is still in its early stages of development and continue to improve and expand. Currently planned functions include guideRNA design, saturation library design, deep sequenced data analysis, and guide RNA activity prediction.

## Who should use GenET?
GenET was developed for anyone interested in the field of genome editing. Especially, Genet can provide aid to those with the following objectives.: <br />

- Develop a quick and easy to design an genome editing experiment for a specific gene.
- Perform genome editing analysis based on sequening data
- Predict the activtiy of specific guideRNAs or all guideRNAs designed for editing a specific product.
