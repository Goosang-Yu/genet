GenET (Genome Editing Toolkit) is a library of various python functions for the purpose of analyzing and evaluating data from genome editing experiments. 

GenET is still in its early stages of development and continue to improve and expand. Currently planned functions include guideRNA design, saturation library design, deep sequenced data analysis, and guide RNA activity prediction.
