These genomes consist of long combinations of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) that encode the instructions necessary for various cellular functions. In the case of humans, the genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA sequence information.</p> <p>Within the genome, specific regions contain information crucial for the expression of proteins, necessary for various life processes, and these regions are called genes. Although the terms gene and genome are sometimes used interchangeably, the genome encompasses the entire genetic information, including genes.</p> <p>Genes that accurately carry protein information play a vital role in maintaining normal cellular activities.
